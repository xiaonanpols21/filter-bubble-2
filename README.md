Here is our project for Information Design Responsible IT Filter Bubble. Read [Product Biography](https://www.notion.so/Filter-bubble-ecdfb2ec22ea4e55801230b0a897bdc0) for further information.

## Who are you?

We are Heba, Yen and Xiao Nan. We are students of HvA doing the education CMD. We are doing the ‘themasemester’ Information design.

## What are you going to do?

We are making a simulation about filter bubbles.

## What is your concept?

Kids these days sit on TikTok all day. But what happens if you like only the things you like? We want to let kids know what the consequences are if you like TikToks and come in a filter bubble with their algorithms. 

## How can you use your data visualization?

Like TikToks and see the consequences. Filter on themes to see the changes.
